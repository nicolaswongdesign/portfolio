                        <p>Given that this project is an extension of the Olympics infographic, following their guidelines is crucial. My aim is to learn how to follow guidelines effectively and appropriately, as many bigger brands often have strict predefined boundaries.</p>

My first step involves examining how they expand their previous brand, which includes geometric shapes and the primary four colors.</p>
                        <p>The Olympic style leans towards minimalism, avoiding an overload of content in a confined space. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize overall layout and aesthetics over cramming excessive content together.</p>

                        <p>So, highlight what the whole post is about, avoid small and long texts. Use visual colors and elements for user to slide left to see more of the info. Make them feel curious, dont info dump them all at once.</p>

                        <p>I picked up valuable skills in managing my designs to align with the guidelines and restrictions. Following these guidelines taught me how to space logos appropriately, a skill that can apply to any logo design. I also learned effective spacing between content elements to prevent overcrowding.</p>
                        <h5>What could be improved</h5>
                        <p>I think creating smoother transitions between each post could enhance the sense of unity. While each individual post included a color from the Olympics rings, using more colors could better represent the diversity of the Olympics palette.</p>
