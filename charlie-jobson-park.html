                        <p>This is a client project, our design team competed with two other groups to create promotional advertisement for Charlie Jobson's new natural play park. Charlie, the funder, invested a significant amount in this park so it is accessible to students and the community. Being a part of this community when he was young, this project is his way of giving back. Our responsibility was to create an opening day advertisement, which included a park poster, signage, digital banner, and animation.</p>
                        <h5>Project Goals</h5>
                        <p>The primary objective was to design a meaningful and engaging park poster and banner for elementary families and the local community. Our focus is to explore the use of realistic materials on paper while maintaining authenticity.</p>

                        <h5>What could be improved</h5>
                        <p>Given the time constraints, there wasn't extra time to refine typography and text placements. However, with the available time, we made sure that they were appropriately positioned. While there are minor details in characters and colorings that could be refined, they adds charm to the poster, giving it a childlike and characteristic quality.</p>
